# speech-emotion-recogntion-Conv1
In this project we talk about (SER) machine learning we use CNN (Conv1d), (SER) is  analysis of any kind of signal data over a fixed-length period (such as audio signals).

# Prepare everything before running
Now i want to guide you how to download this project , you have to download the fills and put them in C:\Users\your fill name\fill name, i work with python3.8 also anaconda prompt to download some Libraries. 
To download the libraries , you must have to write in anaconda prompt,exe:(pip install numpy).

# download dataset

# how to run the code 
Firstlly after you upload the code to python and save the dataset and change all the pathe 
By where you saved the files , you run first Datasetload creates a folder in name joblib that save the Datasetload after you run this section of code , secondlly you run file model in this file we see the we use Conv1D, and we save the model in folder by name model.h5 after we run this section un the console we see the accurse that we got from the test 
finally we run predictTest , in this file do tests for sound to what is the emotion that we got and we do this for all emotion to bemore eayse when we run the code to see what is the emotion for this sound
